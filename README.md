# üí´ About Me:
üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Priel. I'm a Computer Science student specializing in the development of data-intensive backend systems and applied AI.\
 I am passionate about the entire software lifecycle, from architecting robust, object-oriented systems to deploying scalable, real-world applications.

<br>

üéØ **I‚Äôm currently focused on:**<br>
Building a full-stack **Receipt Intelligence Platform** from the ground up. The project transforms physical receipts into structured, actionable data using a sophisticated computer vision pipeline. Key features include:
* A high-performance backend API built with **Python** and **FastAPI**.
* An **OpenCV** and **Tesseract OCR** engine for data extraction, including line-item parsing.
* A **PostgreSQL** database for storing structured receipt data and user information.
* A business intelligence service to provide automated spending analytics and insights.
* The entire application is containerized with **Docker** for robust and scalable deployment.

<br>

üå± **My core areas of interest are:**
* **Backend Architecture:** Designing and building scalable, high-performance APIs and backend systems.
* **Computer Vision & AI:** Developing end-to-end pipelines to extract meaningful insights from complex, real-world data.
* **Database Systems:** Focusing on efficient data modeling and management for both relational (SQL) and non-relational (NoSQL) databases.
* **Software Engineering Practices:** Applying principles of system design, automated testing, and clean code to build robust and maintainable applications.

<br>

ü§ù **I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on:**<br>
Challenging projects in backend development, data engineering, or applied AI. I am particularly interested in contributing to open-source tools that provide tangible, real-world value.
